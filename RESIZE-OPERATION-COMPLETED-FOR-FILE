In a busy system with lots of DML (insert/update/delete),the alert log could be flooded with many such file extension messages.

CAUSE
**********
These file extension messages were result of diagnostic enhancement through unpublished to record automatic datafile resize operations in the alert log with a message of the form:

 "File NN has auto extended from x bytes to y bytes"

This can be useful when diagnosing problems which may be impacted by a file resize.


SOLUTION
***********
In busy systems, the alert log could be completely flooded with file extension messages. A new Hidden parameter parameter "_disable_file_resize_logging" has been introduced through bug 18603375 to stop these messages getting logged into alert log.

(Unpublished) Bug 18603375 - EXCESSIVE FILE EXTENSION MESSAGE IN ALERT LOG 

Set the below parameter along with the fix.

SQL> alter system set "_disable_file_resize_logging"=TRUE ; (Its default value is FALSE)
